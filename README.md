# Hi there, I'm Reza Darzi 👋

**LLM Engineer · Reinforcement Learning (RL)**  
Ex **Strategic Manager / Project Manager**

- 🔭 Current focus: **Agentic AI +‌ RL**, agents & tool-use, retrieval, evals & safety
- 🧠 Research interests: **Reasoning models | Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** reward modeling, offline/online RL, policy gradients, bandits
- ⚙️ Practical: scalable serving (FastAPI/Django), monitoring, experiment tracking

## 🔹 Highlights
- Led projects end-to-end: from strategy & roadmap → MVP → production.
- Bridging **research ↔ product**: clean APIs, reproducible training, measurable impact.
- Comfortable with metrics, defines objectives and tracks results(OKRs), and stakeholder alignment.

## 🛠️ Tech I use
**LLMs/Tooling:** Hugging Face Transformers, OpenAI API, vLLM, LangChain  
**RL:** Stable-Baselines3, RLlib, gymnasium  
**Training/Infra:** PyTorch, JAX (basic), CUDA, Weights & Biases, MLflow  
**Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Celery, Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL

## 📌 Selected work
- **[Project A — RLHF pipeline]**: Data → preference → reward model → PPO fine-tune → evals  
- **[Project B — Agentic RAG]**: multi-tool agent with retrieval, structured outputs, eval harness  
- **[Project C — Offline RL]**: behavior cloning + CQL baseline on [dataset]

> Add links: demos, notebooks, blog posts, or papers.

## 🧪 Evals & Safety
- Task-specific evals (accuracy/latency/cost), adversarial prompts, regression suites  
- Data governance & prompt hygiene; red-team playbooks

## 🧭 From Strategy to Execution
My background in **strategic management & project management** helps me:  
- define crisp north-stars, roadmap experiments, de-risk unknowns  
- communicate with stakeholders and ship on time

## 🤝 Open to collaborate on
- RLHF/RLAIF pipelines, agent systems, scalable inference & monitoring
